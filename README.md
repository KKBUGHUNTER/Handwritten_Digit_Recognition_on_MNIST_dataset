# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_on_MNIST_dataset
# Handwriting Recognition App

This is a simple Python application that allows users to draw a digit, and the application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the drawn digit. It can serve as a learning resource or a base for more complex projects.

## Features

- Handwriting recognition using a pre-trained model
- Simple and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter
- Display of both true and predicted labels
